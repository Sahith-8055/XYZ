Exercise: Assignment-1
The first step is to implement some code that allows us to calculate the score for a single word. The function get_word_score should accept as input a string of lowercase letters (a word) and return the integer score for that word, using the game's scoring rules.
'''
def get_word_score(word, n):
    """
    Returns the score for a word. Assumes the word is a valid word.
    The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the
    word, multiplied by the length of the word, PLUS 50 points if all n
    letters are used on the first turn.
    Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is
    worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on (see SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES)
    word: string (lowercase letters)
    n: integer (HAND_SIZE; i.e., hand size required for additional points)
    returns: int >= 0
