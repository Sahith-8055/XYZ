'''Problem 1 - Build the Shift Dictionary and Apply Shift'''
# The Message class contains methods that could be used to apply a
# cipher to a string, either to encrypt or to decrypt a message
# (since for Caesar codes this is the same action).

# In the next two questions, you will fill in the methods of the
# Message class found in ps6.py according to the specifications in the
# docstrings. The methods in the Message class already filled in are:
# __init__(self, text)
# The getter method get_message_text(self)
# The getter method get_valid_words(self), notice that this one
# returns a copy of self.valid_words to prevent someone from mutating the
# original list.

# In this problem, you will fill in two methods:
# Fill in the build_shift_dict(self, shift) method of the Message class.
# Be sure that your dictionary includes both lower and upper case
# letters, but that the shifted character for a lower case letter and its
# uppercase version are lower and upper case instances of the
# same letter. What this means is that if the original letter is "a" and
# its shifted value is "c", the letter "A" should shift to the letter "C".

# If you are unfamiliar with the ordering or characters of the English alphabet,
# we will be following the letter ordering displayed by
# string.ascii_lowercase and string.ascii_uppercase:

# >>> import string
# >>> print(string.ascii_lowercase)
# abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
# >>> print(string.ascii_uppercase)
# ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

# A reminder from the introduction page - characters such as the space character,
# commas, periods, exclamation points, etc will not be encrypted by this cipher
# Basically, all the characters within string.punctuation, plus the space (' ')
# and all numerical characters (0 - 9) found in string.digits.

# Fill in the apply_shift(self, shift) method of the Message class.
# You may find it easier to use build_shift_dict(self, shift).
# Remember that spaces and punctuation should not be changed by the cipher.
